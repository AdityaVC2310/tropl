# Job Description Upload and Parse Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of job description upload and parsing functionality for the recruiter/jobs section, similar to the existing resume upload and parse functionality.

## Implementation Details

### 1. API Endpoint
**File:** `/app/api/upload-job-description/route.ts`
- Created a new API endpoint that mirrors the resume upload functionality
- Supports the same file types: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, JPG, PNG
- Uses Google Gemini AI for parsing job descriptions
- Extracts comprehensive job information including:

  - Location details (city, state, country, remote/hybrid/onsite)
  - Employment type and experience level
  - Salary range information
  - Job description and responsibilities
  - Required skills and qualifications
  - Benefits and contact information
  - Application deadlines and other details

### 2. Custom Hook
**File:** `/hooks/useJobDescriptionUpload.ts`
- Created `useJobDescriptionUpload` hook similar to `useFileUpload`
- Handles file upload with progress tracking
- Provides upload status and progress information
- Returns structured job description data

### 3. Type Definitions
**Interface:** `JobDescriptionData`
- Comprehensive interface for job description information
- Includes nested structures for location, salary range, requirements, and contact info
- Supports all common job posting fields

### 4. UI Integration
**File:** `/components/jobs/CreateJobModal.tsx`
- Enhanced the existing CreateJobModal component

- Upload progress tracking
- User-friendly error messages

## Usage Flow

1. **Upload Selection:** User clicks "Upload Description Document"
2. **File Selection:** User selects PDF, DOC, or other supported file
3. **AI Processing:** File is sent to Gemini AI for extraction
4. **Progress Feedback:** Visual progress indicator shows processing status
5. **Data Extraction:** AI extracts structured job information
6. **Auto-fill:** Form fields are automatically populated
7. **Review & Edit:** User can review and modify extracted data
8. **Continue:** User proceeds to next step with populated data

## Benefits

1. **Time Saving:** Eliminates manual data entry for job postings
2. **Accuracy:** AI extraction reduces human error
3. **Consistency:** Standardized data format across all job postings

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `/app/api/upload-job-description/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `/hooks/useJobDescriptionUpload.ts` - Custom hook
- `/JOB_DESCRIPTION_UPLOAD_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `/components/jobs/CreateJobModal.tsx` - Enhanced UI with upload functionality

## Testing Recommendations

1. **File Format Testing:** Test with various PDF, DOC, DOCX formats
2. **AI Accuracy:** Validate extraction accuracy across different job descriptions
3. **Edge Cases:** Test with unusual formatting or incomplete job descriptions
4. **Performance:** Test with large files and multiple uploads
5. **Error Handling:** Test invalid files and network errors

## Conclusion

The job description upload and parse functionality has been successfully implemented, providing recruiters with an efficient way to create job postings from existing documents. The implementation follows the same patterns as the resume upload functionality while being specifically tailored for job description parsing and form population.
